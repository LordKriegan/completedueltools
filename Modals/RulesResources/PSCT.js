The activation of a Spell or Trap Card always makes a Chain Link, but its effect that resolves with the card itself (if any) does not necessarily use a colon or semicolon. This effect is usually the first effect listed in the card's text.</Text>

Conditions other than target requirements that have be met during both activation and resolution are specifically noted in a seperate sentence after the effect sentence.</Text>

For example: if Player A activates Exchange, and takes Left Leg of the Forbidden One from Player B's hand, then Player A currently possesses the Left Leg of the Forbidden One.
